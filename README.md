### 1. General Advice <a name="general_advice"></a>

* Ask a lot of questions! Don't be afraid to ask. Many times future frustrations about the tech stack or the approval process can get resolved waaay before you even start putting your first line of code down.  

* The two most important questions you can ask are *how* and *why* -- *how* should something be done? *Why* should it be done that way? You have valuable experience, and should (slowly!) question why and how things are done.

* Spend 15-30 minutes googling a problem before asking for help from a senior dev or on helpme. This will build up your debugging muscles!

* Here's a great article <a href="http://motto.time.com/4116259/google-search/">on how to google effectively.</a> Let this be your guide to improving your google fu.

* Any time you get a sense that an error you get in your setup or development process might be repeated later, write the error and the fix down! Very often, the problems I get in my console that prevent me from working are solved by a few simple commands, and you save a lot of time by knowing you've seen an error before, even months previous.

* Try to spend some time getting acclimated to the culture of the place. If other staff members prefer to be contacted over Slack instead of tapped on the shoulder and interrupted while they're working through a problem, best to get in the habit of doing things that way.

### 2. Development Environment <a name="dev_environment"></a>

* _VSC_ -- Vsc lets you export your custom settings (it's just a giant JS object anyway), so you can import / copy-paste that into your machine at work when you're done.

* _git_ -- More important than what you use to manage your workflow (Github, Sourcetree, plain ol' git on the command line, etc., etc.) is that you have a setup that you like and that you know. Get comfortable with how git works and you'll be able to pick up anything your workplace uses to manage development very easily - or know if you'd prefer to not use it at all.

### 3. What my day one was like <a name="day_one"></a>

> "for me, it was three days of just setup. Somewhere along the way I asked for a 101 on the company's tech stack and where my work as a FE fit into all of that. After that it was learning the jira / QA process and participating in the standups. Did very little actual work. - _Miguel_

> "My first day at my first new job I was thrown RIGHT in the deep end. No HR, no onboarding -- just go hard, nerd. If you find yourself in this situation, remember -- everything's gonna be okay. Take a deep breath, roll up your sleeves and don't let 'em see you sweat -- even if you're terrified! - _Jordyn_

> "My first day at my first job out of bootcamp felt very intense at the time - basically just being left to set up a dev environment with an old readme for directions, beginning to pick up tasks and fix bugs, it felt like a lot of pressure at the time - but it's amazing, thinking back, how quickly it began to feel like home. Every place has a different onboarding process, but the one thing they have in common is they all want you to succeed. You got this!" - _Adam_
