### 1. General Advice <a name="general_advice"></a>

* Ask a lot of questions! Don't be afraid to ask. Many times future frustrations about the tech stack or the approval process can get resolved waaay before you even start putting your first line of code down.  



### 2. Development Environment <a name="dev_environment"></a>

* _VSC_ -- Vsc lets you export your custom settings (it's just a giant JS object anyway), so you can import / copy-paste that into your machine at work when you're done.


### 3. What my day one was like <a name="day_one"></a>

> "for me, it was three days of just setup. Somewhere along the way I asked for a 101 on the company's tech stack and where my work as a FE fit into all of that. After that it was learning the jira / QA process and participating in the standups. Did very little actual work. - _Miguel_
